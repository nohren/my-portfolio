 **My Favorite things**
  - I love travel and the thrill of experiencing new things.
  - Exercise is a much needed body, mind, soul reset / refresh.
  - Immersive experiences.  Google earth VR let me travel long before I was able to.
  - Taquerias
  - The skill of coding is the next frontier in the cause of human freedom.  Technology is a tool like anything else and can be used for good and bad.
