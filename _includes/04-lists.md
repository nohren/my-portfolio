 **My Favorite things**
  - I love travel and the thrill of experiencing new things.
  - Exercise, for me, is a much needed body, mind and soul refreshment.
  - Immersive experiences for the perspective shift.  Google earth VR let me travel long before I was able to transport  my body away from my job.
  - Taquerias
  - Coding as the skillset most on the frontier of 21st century human agency, freedom and self determination (if it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg) as well as collective determination (voting and democracy).  Technology is a tool like anything else and being used for both good and bad.  The consequencies of either will continue to multiply as we continue to entertwine reality with the digital.
