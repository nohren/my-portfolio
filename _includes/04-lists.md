 **My Favorite things**
  - I love travel, culture and the thrill of experiencing new things.
  - Exercise, for me, is a much needed body, mind and soul refreshment.
  - Immersive experiences for the perspective shift.  Google earth VR let me travel long before I was able to transport  my body away from my job.
  - Taquerias
  - Coding as the skillset most on the frontier of 21st century human freedom.  Freedom being the right to self determination (if it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg) as well as collective determination (voting and democracy).  A tool is used for its efficacy and efficiency, for both good and bad. Staying aware of our ships direction will be the key as we continue to the build the ideal world and entertwine reality with our digital tools.
